          <h3>Angelina</h3>
          <p>Maid of Honour</p>
          <p>She may have spent most of our childhood bullying me (with love, of course... I think), but I wouldn’t want anyone else by my side on this day. My sister, my best friend, and my forever partner-in-crime — I couldn’t say “I do” without her.</p>

          <h3>Hope</h3>
          <p>Bridesmaid</p>
          <p>My forever best friend — we’ve been inseparable since kindergarten! From playground adventures to wedding planning, she’s been by my side through it all. I’m so lucky to have her standing with me on this day.</p>

          <h3>Johanna</h3>
          <p>Bridesmaid</p>
          <p>We met through mutual friends, and from the very first conversation, it felt like we’d known each other our whole lives. We instantly became best friends — the kind of friendship that just fits. She’s been there for every laugh, every vent session, and every little moment in between. I’m so lucky to have her in my corner and even luckier to have her standing beside me on such an important day.</p>

          <h3>Maddy</h3>
          <p>Bridesmaid</p>
          <p>We may have only met five years ago, but it feels like I’ve known her forever. She’s one of the kindest, funniest, and most supportive people I know, and I absolutely adore her. So grateful to have her by my side on this special day.</p>

          <h3>Sara</h3>
          <p>Bridesmaid</p>
          <p>We met while working at West Park Bowling, and she quickly became my go-to for absolutely everything. From late-night talks to endless laughs, she’s been such a constant in my life — I’m so lucky to have her by my side on this day.</p>

          <h3>Klein</h3>
          <p>Bridesmaid</p>
          <p>We met during COVID while working at a nursing home, and we quickly bonded over our shared interests. What started as coworkers turned into best friends, and I soon realized what an incredible, kind, and genuine person he is. I’m so grateful for his friendship and can’t wait to have him by my side on this special day.</p>
